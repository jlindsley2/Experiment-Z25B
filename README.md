# Experiment-Z25B

## This project involves creating the most... interesting website that we are capable of. It is an example of perfect teamwork - yet it is also a duel in who has the poorest sense of humour, and the strongest creativity and ability to turn ideas into code.

## Project rules:
1. Nothing NSFW or that employers would frown upon (rule subject to interpretation)
2. No deleting or permanently hiding the other's features, unless these are breaking a rules or if they are breaking the project.
3. Only one html file is allowed - the webpage must function as a single-page app.
4. No references to external webpages or resources in any other way than through conventional <a> html links. All resources must exist in the repository.
5. Apart from 'index.html', only files the following types are allowed: .js, .css, any audio file, any image file.
6. Epilepsy-inducing content must exist in moderation at most.
